        The Math Team is open to all high school students, regardless of mathematical ability. The
        primary program of the BCA Math Team is intended for a high school audience, and runs most
        Saturdays from 1:00-4:00pm. Admission to this program for any student not yet in grade 9 is
        by invitation only, and such invitations will be extended only by a math team coach. Most
        weeks, there will be a paired set of lectures (introductory and intermediate), and a contest
        or practice contest. Some weeks will be devoted in their entirety to contests, and in some
        cases may extend past the regular hours. Materials from previous lectures can be found at{' '}

                    all students are welcome at all Math Team events, whenever possible.
